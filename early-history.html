        <h2>Early History</h2>
        <p>In its early years, music that would eventually be referred to as "Dream Pop" often took inspiration from the <a href="https://rxmusic.com/editorial/rx-music-genre-breakdown-dream-pop/">post-punk and psychedelic</a> bands of the 60s, 70s and 80s. Also referred to as alt-rock, Scottish band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocteau_Twins">Cocteau Twins</a> pioneered the early dream pop sound through their unique, "dreamy" sound, aided by sometimes nonsensical vocals and a multitude of reverb and chorus effects. British band Slowdive came onto the scene in the early 90s with hazy, nostalgic soundscapes that are often interchangeably described as both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegaze">shoegaze</a> and dream pop. Although these two genres share much in common (and lots of music can be described as both), shoegaze leans further into a hazy, alt-rock style than dream pop.</p>
